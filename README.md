## Overview

This repository details how to train, validate, and test a ResNet-18 CNN to classify blue whale A and B calls in 30 second spectrogram windows. The opensource Python package, [opensoundscape](https://opensoundscape.org/en/latest/), is used for preprocessing and model training. The model is trained on publicly available acoustic data from the [DCLDE 2015 Workshop](https://www.cetus.ucsd.edu/dclde/).
