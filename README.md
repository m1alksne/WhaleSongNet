## Overview

This repository details how to train, validate, and test a ResNet-18 CNN to classify blue whale A and B calls in 30 second spectrogram windows. The opensource Python package, opensoundscape, is used for preprocessing and model training. The model is trained on publically available acoustic data from central and southern California.
